				<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hey! I'm Naut van der Winden, but you might know me by my online aliases "ScottishPuffin" or "MrMacTavish" I am a Software Development student from the Netherlands. Currently, I am studying IT at the <a href="https://www.reacollege.nl/" target="_blank">REA College</a>. I currently posses the following certificates:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://verify.openedg.org/?id=DDHO.zTEo.4gfX" target="_blank">PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://verify.openedg.org/?id=xrxz.Trkq.anSO" target="_blank">PCAP™ – Certified Associate Python Programmer</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>I am working towards CPA and CPE certifications for C++. I can currently write simple projects using C++ (see <a href="projects.html">projects</a>).</p>
				<p>The main thing that draws me to programming is being able to solve problems. I really enjoy finding my own solutions to a problem. I've had a keen interest in programming since I was about 10, starting with very rudementary html. Later I learned python and played around with Raspberry Pi SBCs. During my highschool time, I've probably spent more time programming during classes than paying attention. It was often hard to find motivation for projects though, so I have rather little to show for it.</p>
				<h2>About this site</h2>
				<p>I've had multiple portfolios over the years. I started work on this version after finding <a href="https://sadgrlonline.github.io/archived-sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/" target="_blank">sadgrl's Layout Builder</a> and being hit with what I assume to be Secondhand Nostalgia for the old 90's-00's web. Seriously go check it out, she has some great tools and content on <a href="https://sadgrlonline.github.io/archived-sadgrl.online/" target="_blank">her archived website</a>.</p>
				<h2>About me (personal</h2>
				<p>I enjoy programming, gaming and hiking. I also like old (60's-80's) music, along with some obscure late-soviet/early russian music. My favourite bands among them being КИНО (Kino) and Фристайл (Freestyle).</p>
