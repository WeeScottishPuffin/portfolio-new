				<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
				<p>Hey! I'm Naut van der Winden, but you might know me by my online aliases "ScottishPuffin" or "SirMrMacTavish" I am a Software Development student from the Netherlands. I enjoy programming, gaming and hiking. I also like old (60's-80's) music, along with some obscure-ish late-soviet/early russian music. My favourite bands among them being КИНО (Kino) and Фристайл (Freestyle).</p> 
				<p>The main thing that draws me to programming is being able to solve problems. I really enjoy finding my own way of solving a problem and trying things out. I've been programming since I was about 10, first starting with very rudementary html. Later I learned python and played around with Raspberry Pi SBCs. My fascination of programming and computers stayed through my highschool time, where I've probably spent more time programming during than paying attention. It was often hard to find motivation for projects though, so I have rather little to show for it.</p>
				<p>As of now, I am studying for certificates (CPE and CPA) in C++.  </p>

				<h2>About this site</h2>
				<p>I've had multiple portfolios over the years. I started building this version after being hit with what I can only describe as Secondhand Nostalgia for the old 90's-00's web. I found <a href="https://sadgrlonline.github.io/archived-sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/">sadgrl's Layout Builder</a> and quite liked the style.</p>
